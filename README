Automated release notes for apps hosted on pivotaltracker.com.  Allows release notes to be generated for any project on pivotaltracker.com by retrieving the latest iteration for the specified project and displaying the completed features, bugs, and chores.

Note: It's recommended you define a story of type 'release' for each iteration to properly show the title,start/end dates, and points on the release notes.

Currently there is only support for .html or .txt output.

Planned:
